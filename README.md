## Curved Lane Detection and Turn Prediction
- Lane detection plays a vital role in the functionality of autonomous vehicles, offering significant real-world applications. 
- It enables vehicles to remain within their designated lane, maintain safe speeds, and manage appropriate distances from other cars, ensuring secure navigation.
- This system leverages computer vision techniques to identify and monitor road lanes and surrounding vehicles.
- By analyzing video frames captured by a camera, the goal is to develop a real-time solution that can be integrated into autonomous vehicles.

For setting up the project, do the following steps:
1. The DIP_Report is the report file that gives the idea and solution to the curved lane and turn prediction problem.
2. In Lane_Detection.py, there is a line which takes the video file as input written as
```
input_video = cv2.VideoCapture('input_video_name.mp4')
```
and output file as 
```
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output_video_name.avi', fourcc, 20.0, (width, height)) 
```
3. The input folder contains all the input video files that are used by us.
4. The output folder contains all the output files that are generated by giving input files to the code.
